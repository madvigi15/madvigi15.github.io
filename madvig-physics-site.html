                    <h1>Physics</h1>
                    <p>I grew up watching things like Bill Nye the Science Guy and National Geographic videos. They always fascinated me, enticed me into learning something I didn't already know. I gained the knowledge of some awesome things by watching these shows, from how atmospheric pressure can generate force to how mountain goats are able to scale sheer cliffs. What I didn't know at the time was that all these things I learned all belonged to the realm of Science.</p>
                    <p>Later I was introduced to the likes of Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Niel deGrasse Tyson and others like them. These pioneers of the subject not only advanced Physics by leaps and bounds but society as a whole. Not only are Stephen Hawking's groundbreaking theories about blackholes fascinating, he is also an inspiration to many through his fight against ALS. Michio Kaku has given us a way to reach into the future through his ideas and bringing the realm of science fiction closer to home. Niel deGrasse Tyson inspires a new generation of scientists by making Physics accessible to anyone, no matter how complex the concept. These are the people that inspired me and showed me what I really wanted to study in my life.</p>
                    <p>So when I went to college I chose to be a Physics major before I even started looking for colleges. I eventually deicided to study at Hanover College, a beautiful school on top of the Ohio river, in southern Indiana. It had a very impressive science curriculum and some truly fantastic professors in the my disipline. Over my four years here I studied everything from general physics all the way up to quantum mechanics. I learned an immense amount and am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in the future.</p>
