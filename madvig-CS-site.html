                    <h1>Computer Science</h1>
                    <p>At the beginning of my Junior year in college I needed to fill an empty class slot and decided to take the intro Computer Science course. The course was recomended for Physics majors and I had always enjoyed playing video games and thought I might enjoy trying to make some. However, what I discovered was an area of study that I truly loved. For the remaining semesters I attended college I took as many Computer Science courses as I could, actually attaining a minor in it in only three semesters. After discovering my interest in the subject I spent a lot of my time in the summers in between school years fidelling with different coding languages and learning as much as I could. I discovered many online resources that were an enormous help in learning basic coding skills for various languages that allowed me to get a leg up in my Computer Science courses.</p>
